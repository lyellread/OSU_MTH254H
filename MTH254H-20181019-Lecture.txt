Concepts
Partial Derivative: If doing the partial derivative for x (usually denoted by f_x_, then treat y as a constant, and derive. 
Second Partial Derivatives: There are four of these for a two variable function. Fof f(x,y), find f_x_ and f_y_ and then use those to derive again to find f_xx_, f_xy_, f_yx_, f_yy_.
Using Limit Derivative Defenition to Calculate Partial Derivatives: jesus thats quite the title ;). The limit defenitions are: f_x_ = (lim h-->0) [f(x+h, y)-f(x,y)]/h,  f_y_ = (lim h-->0) [f(x, y+h)-f(x,y)]/h
