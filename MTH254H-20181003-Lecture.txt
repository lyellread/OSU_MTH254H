Definitions
Position: vec(r)(t) = <x(t), y(t), z(t)>
Velocity: vec(v)(t) =

Concepts
Functions On Sphere Centered at O: |r(t)| = c and r(t) dot r(t) = c^2 and 2r(t) sot r'(t) = 0 (because r(t) _|_ r'(t). Explanation: r(t) is the position vector (O --> point) that defines the point on the curve at t. The derivative (r'(t)) is _|_ to that curve as it is tangent to the curve, thus _|_ to the position vector that defines the point.

Notes
Example Derivation in "R"^2: vec(r)(t) = d<cos(t),sin(t)> --> vec(v)(t) = vec(r)'(t) = d<-sin(t), cos(t)> --> vec(a)(t) = vec(v)'(t) = vec(r)"(t) = -d<cos(t),sin(t)>
